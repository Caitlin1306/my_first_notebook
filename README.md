# My first notebook

This is my first notebook, I completed these tasks during my 12 week bootcamp.
I learned about defining variables (integers, floats, Booleans and strings) & reassigning variables etc

## Examples of code i have learnt 

Please see below examples of code i have learnt:

I created a conversation that takes user input and prints information using the input eg

len('Hello')
name = input("what is your name?")
print("Hello " + name)
men_lifting_weights_emojis = int(input("How many men lifting weights emojis would you like?"))
print("üèãÔ∏è" * men_lifting_weights_emojis)

I also edited code that was incorrect eg i chanaged **4theloveofcode** to **fourtheloveofcode** = "Hello world" as i was informed numbers makes the readability of the code confusing and therefore cause an error/names cannot start with a number

Another example of edited code that i corrected was mine&yours = "Our budget" to mine_and_yours = "Our budget" as names can not contain spaces, so we use _ instead and names can not contain any of these symbols eg :'",<>/?|!@#%^&*~-+ 

Please see attached hyperlink to where i found information and practiced code: [Variables Practice](https://deepnote.com/workspace/katia-punter-1f84-20b2cf09-5782-4ce3-8cf7-1522f2bd3efb/project/variables-data-types-d1b4c8ad-c09d-4ba7-8b1c-94f5cad60958/%2Fnotebook.ipynb)

### Diffrent websites i have used to practice code

I have been using github, deepnotes, hackmd, replit and datacamp

Using replit i edited and added my own code to create 3 circles using python turtle. Please see below the code i used to do so. :)

import turtle # imports the module so we can use its methods
my_turtle=turtle.Turtle() # create a Turtle named my_turtle
my_turtle.speed(20)
my_turtle.color('blue')

for i in range(0,36):
  for i in range(0,4):
    my_turtle.forward(100)
    my_turtle.right(90)
  my_turtle.color('purple')
  my_turtle.circle(50)
  my_turtle.color('blue')
  my_turtle.right(15)
  my_turtle.right(35)
  my_turtle.circle(70)
  my_turtle.color('red')
  my_turtle.forward(90)
  my_turtle.right(80)
  my_turtle.color('yellow')
  my_turtle.forward(150)
  my_turtle.right(120)
  my_turtle.color('orange')
  my_turtle.circle(60)
  my_turtle.color('green')
my_turtle.forward(500)
for i in range(0,36):
  for i in range(0,4):
    my_turtle.forward(100)
    my_turtle.right(90)
  my_turtle.color('purple')
  my_turtle.circle(50)
  my_turtle.color('blue')
  my_turtle.right(15)
  my_turtle.right(35)
  my_turtle.circle(70)
  my_turtle.color('red')
  my_turtle.forward(90)
  my_turtle.right(80)
  my_turtle.color('yellow')
  my_turtle.forward(150)
  my_turtle.right(120)
  my_turtle.color('orange')
  my_turtle.circle(60)
  my_turtle.circle(60)
  my_turtle.color('green')
my_turtle.forward(500)
for i in range(0,36):
  for i in range(0,4):
    my_turtle.forward(100)
    my_turtle.right(90)
  my_turtle.color('purple')
  my_turtle.circle(50)
  my_turtle.color('blue')
  my_turtle.right(15)
  my_turtle.right(35)
  my_turtle.circle(70)
  my_turtle.color('red')
  my_turtle.forward(90)
  my_turtle.right(80)
  my_turtle.color('yellow')
  my_turtle.forward(150)
  my_turtle.right(120)
  my_turtle.color('orange')
  my_turtle.circle(60)
  my_turtle.circle(60)
  my_turtle.color('green')
