# My first notebook

This is my first notebook, I completed these tasks during my 12 week bootcamp.
I learned about defining variables (integers, floats, Booleans and strings) & reassigning variables etc

## Examples of code I have learnt 

Please see below examples of code I have learnt:

I created a conversation that takes user input and prints information using the input eg

```
len('Hello')
name = input("what is your name?")
print("Hello " + name)
men_lifting_weights_emojis = int(input("How many men lifting weights emojis would you like?"))
print("üèãÔ∏è" * men_lifting_weights_emojis)
```

I also edited code that was incorrect eg I changed **4theloveofcode** to **fourtheloveofcode** = "Hello world" as I was informed numbers makes the readability of the code confusing and therefore cause an error/names cannot start with a number

Another example of edited code that I corrected was mine&yours = "Our budget" to mine_and_yours = "Our budget" as names can not contain spaces, so we use _ instead and names can not contain any of these symbols eg :'",<>/?|!@#%^&*~-+

### Diffrent websites I have used to practice code

I have been using github, deepnotes, hackmd, replit and datacamp
